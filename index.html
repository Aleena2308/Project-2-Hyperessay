        <p class="text">M&M's are an old fashioned candy favourite! They first came out in 1941, and are still as
         popular today as ever. M&M's Candy is sold in over 100 countries and there are over 40
         million individual M&M Candy made every day. The original M&M's Candy was bright
         candy-coated milk chocolate. The second introduction was M&M's with peanuts. Now
         M&M Candy has extensively expanded its flavours. M&M's Candy now comes in peanut
         butter, pretzel, dark chocolate, caramel, almond and even strawberry. Any and every one
         of M&M's flavours is delicious. So go on, try them all, and let them "melt in your mouth,
         not in your hands".</p>

         lollipops. Blow Pop comes in so many flavours it's hard to just choose one! Some of their
         more modern flavours are Sour Apple, Black Ice, Blue Razz,What-A-Melon and Candy

       <p class="text">"Unexplainably juicy" yes, the perfect description of a Starburst.These soft chewy, taffy
        morsels of goodness have been around since 1967. Starburst was once called "Opal
        Fruits'' when it was first made in England, but upon its arrival here to North America, the
        name was fittingly changed to Starburst.I can't imagine eating a candy called Opal
        Fruits, Starburst is where it's at. The name is so fitting for the exciting, intense burst of
        flavour in every bite.Starburst are great for sharing, or trying to bribe someone.
        They come in a great little convenient package, just the right size for pockets too!</p>

     <h1 class="text">Swedish Fish</h1>
       <p class="text">You might not like tuna fish but these Swedish Fish are hard to resist! Always a go-to
        candy at the corner store, easy to stuff your brown paper bag with, even easier to eat.
        Swedish Fish Candy came out in the 1950s, and remains a retro candy favourite. Their
        sweet fruity flavour is sort of a mystery. Some say cherry, others say raspberry.
        Actually they say the flavour of Swedish Fish is more of an exotic berry called
        lingonberry. Whatever the berry, we'll take them. This retro candy is a must-have for any
        age. Who knew that these retro fish were so exotic!</p>

       <p class="text">They might be tiny, but they're oh so crunchy, tangy and delicious! A box of Nerds Candy
        comes with two separate compartments and two different flavours all in one small and
        colourful box. Nerds Candy is inspired by Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory. They
        are a magical tiny burst of explosive flavour, from very sweet, to extremely sour. Nerds
        Candy are especially good when you have a great big mouthful of them and then try to
        talk. You can even mix and match the flavours of the box, or just eat one side at a time.
        Nerds are a retro candy from the 1970s and are still so groovy!</p>

       <p class="text">Our list would not be complete without some classic licorice candy. Twizzlers are the
        most popular licorice candy that is consumed in North America. Red or black licorice,
        Nibs or the original, it's an old fashioned candy that the world certainly loves to eat.
        Twizzlers make one million miles of the stuff every year! That amounts to circling the
        globe 40 times! It's even a part of the famous boxer, Floyd Mayweather's pre-fight diet.
        Twizzlers also has the ability to be used as a straw! Just bite both ends off and voila, you
        have a straw that's environmentally friendly, not to mention delicious! Here's an
        interesting fact: only the black licorice from Twizzlers has real licorice extract in it.</p>
